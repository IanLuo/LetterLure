Chunkfive derives from the team at The League of Moveable Type. With a motto of providing only the best fonts within the interweb, Chunkfive is a perfect example of their high standards. An ultra-bold slab serif, Chunkfive has all the ingredients for great headings and titles. The fact that it also contains lower case means that it could also work in body set text. If you're looking for a vintage Americana feel, then Chunkfive is your guy.
