Brazilian graphic designer Nelson Balaban is known for his outlandish style and fun approach to typography. Accent is just one example of his exemplary work that has been featured in many editorial and commercial campaigns. On first impression, Accent could look a tad on the hipster side but we love it and we think you should too. If you end up using the font, all Nelson asks is that you don't alter it, give credit where it's due and use it to create some "kick-ass work". Off you go then!
