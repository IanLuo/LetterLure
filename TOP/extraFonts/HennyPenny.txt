Henny Penny is an offbeat display font with loads of personality, named in honour of the fairy-tale character chicken Henny Penny. It is a friendly and playful decorative typeface. Its classical nature is successfully hidden behind its very informal structure: There is no common baseline, no common character size and no common slope of the letters. This makes the typeface very amusing. Henny Penny is a headline typeface for using in display typography. It may be used for childrenâ€™s books, magazines and websites.
