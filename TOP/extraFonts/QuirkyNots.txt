This typeface was specifically created for my Typography 6 class but I decided to release it for free because I know I wouldnâ€™t have further developed it after I finished college. This was a great experience and have learned a lot. I would love to see what people would do with it. So, I hope you enjoy the font :D use it, share it and if you want to modify it, go ahead. Do whatever you want with it. It is fully available to use anywhere; no restrictions.
