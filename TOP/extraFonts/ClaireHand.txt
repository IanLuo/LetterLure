The newly created team scope font ‘Claire Hand’ is fun, bold and friendly, and its ‘handwritten’ style represents our commitment to creative spontaneity (you know how the best ideas get scribbled down on a napkin?). Because we’re serious design tragics, we even created each letter in three different weights so it’s even more individual.
